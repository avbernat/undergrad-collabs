# Problem Set 6 | 13 May 2020 - 20 May 2020 at 10 AM

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Problem 1.**

Write a while-while loop (nested while loop) that evaluates b until it's 3 and x until it's 5.

```{r}

```

**Problem 2.**

Write a while-while loop (nested while loop) to check the number of palindrome numbers present between two limits.

What are palindromes? *Palindromes -  a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.*

Use readline() as a way to input any upper or lower limit and a Boolean flag in your program to inform you that a palindrom was detected.

```{r}



# Q: Below, described your code in words. If you had to explain to someone what this code is doing and how each function, loop, or equation works, what would you say? 
```
